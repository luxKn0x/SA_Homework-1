# Document Editor – Factory Design Pattern (Java)

This project demonstrates the use of the Factory Design Pattern
to implement a flexible document editor that supports multiple
document formats such as PDF, Word, and HTML.

## Design Pattern
Factory Pattern

## Key Benefits
- Editor is not tightly coupled to document types
- New formats can be added without modifying the editor
- Object creation logic is centralized

## How It Works
The DocumentFactory creates document objects based on user input.
The Editor interacts only with the Document interface.

## How to Run
Compile and run Main.java.
